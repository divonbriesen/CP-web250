# web250
## For a full-class collaborative project that connects a dynamic site to a database and includes logins/user management.
 for web 250 class
1. Get this introduction/participants application up and running- copied to each person's repository and deployed to elocker on a regular basis as a way of learning everything
   1. SETUP - get an introduction up on a site with php nicely
      1. include all standard folders (images, styles, scripts)
      1. make new folders - subfolder in images for users, add contents and components
      1. put header and footer and other repeating items (navbars?) into components as include files 
      1. make sure all is handled and setup with github on server and your workstation 
   1. Functionality - start making it dynamic
      3. Use the $_GET["id"] to pull values and populate image for that users based on menu item clicked
      4. write the array(s) to hold sample info from your profile
      5. write code to loop thru that and display it on the screen.
   1. Start with changing the page
      1. Use a for loop to make a menu that lets you select individual ids (i.e 1-3)
      1. Capture that id using $_GET and use it to show a different picture, after putting a similar number of pictures in the folder
      1. Now modify your arrays to incorporate 3 users...
      1. Modify your code to use this with loops/foreach
      1. Use these models to model a database to use instead of the arrays
   1. Build the database and link to it
      1. Add sample values for three users
   1. Build the interface for inputting users
      1. Create list of courses (id's and names) and use AJAX to get on screen
   1. Build login interface
      1. id/password field in user table
      2. admin level/flag 
1. Get the code from the _Joy of PHP_ up and running, including sessions and login (may be in book The _Joy of Sessions_ or whatever it's called) - on each person's elocker, done individually and customized/improved along the way
1. Build individual projects using these techniques
   1. Must have user management and login with hashed or equivalent passwords
   1. Must use a database with at least a many to many relationship (which means at least 3 tables) for the main functionality
   1. Styled and branded and validated and pretty :P
1. Possibly some kind of WordPress work, as that makes up a lot of the database driven stuff out there.
